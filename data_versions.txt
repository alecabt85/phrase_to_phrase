processed_data_v1: Data file in which the anchor tag and the target phrase have been 
    encoded with "bert-base-uncased" model and the [CLS] vector, which is the first vector
    of the output, has been taken as the word embedding.  The cpc demographic data columns
    have been cateogorically encoded.  








Ideas to Explore: 
    - mapping the cpc group, subgroup, etc terms to their representations in the data
    and then making a questions like "Does <target> belong in <section> <class> <subclass>
    <group> <subgroup>?" and then taking a sentence transformation of that question as 
    input data to a model
